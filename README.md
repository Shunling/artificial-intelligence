<h3>Built a sudoku game</h3></div> 
algorithms: 
nakid twins, eliminate, only_choice and repeatedly applied those to solve the game.

<h3>Built a planning agent</h3></div>
algorithms:
implementing symbolic logic and search algorithm, and experimented 11 search algorithms with different heuristics to compare which is the best in terms of space and time complexity.
